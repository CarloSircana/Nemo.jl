# Finite field embeddings

## Introduction

Nemo allows the construction of finite field embeddings making use of the
algorithm of Bosma, Cannon and Steel behind the scenes to ensure compatibility.

## Embedding functionality

### First set of functions

```@docs
example(::Int, ::Int)
```
**Examples**

```julia
# some julia code showing how to use these functions
```

### Next set of functions

```@docs
example(::Int, ::Int)
```
**Examples**

```julia
# some julia code showing how to use these functions                                     ```

### Etc.

```@docs
example(::Int, ::Int)
```
**Examples**

```julia
# some julia code showing how to use these functions                                     ```
